#WPM Calculator

This is a website that I built with [Andy Yang](https://github.com/theandyyang). It tests the user's typing speed in net words per minute(WPM) by typing 50 randomly generated English words. The formula for calculating the net WPM was provided by [Speed Typing Online](http://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations). Our site was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap. Try out the latest version [here!](http://www.web.uvic.ca/~ryansama/WPM-Calculator/)

####Issues

There are still several improvements that can be made to the website. For example, skipping a word can cause the timer to continue without stopping.
